# Introduction
This project allows you to monitor your house’s temperature whenever you want to, with all your devices with a browser (i.e. your smartphone, your tablet or your computer).
To do this, it is necessary to link an AWS IoT Button and a Raspberry Pi 3 model B (and a temperature sensore like TMP102) with AWS IoT, AWS Lambda and AWS SNS; also requires Node.js and Python languages and a bit of MQTT knoledge.
I decided to realize this work for the exam of Pervasive Systems, as a student of MSc in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza - University of Rome.
# 1. Configuring your AWS IoT Button
First of all, it’s needed to connect to a Wi-Fi Network your AWS IoT Button and to link it with your AWS Account. You can easily accomplish this goal with the app for Android or iOS or by following this guide.
# 2. Creating a Lambda rule with AWS Lambda
# 3. Creating an Amazon SNS Rule
# 4. Connecting Raspberry Pi 3 to AWS
# 5. Reading temperature and sending data to AWS
